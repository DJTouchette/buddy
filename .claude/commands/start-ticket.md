Read the ticket start file at `.claude/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/start.md` to understand the ticket requirements.

Then follow this workflow:

1. **Explore the codebase** — Understand the architecture, patterns, and relevant code areas
2. **Create a plan** — Write your implementation plan to `.claude/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/plan.md` with:
   - Summary of changes needed
   - Files to modify/create
   - Step-by-step approach
   - Any risks or considerations
3. **Begin implementation** — Start implementing the plan
4. **Track progress** — Update `.claude/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/trace.md` as you work with:
   - What you've done so far
   - Files modified
   - Any decisions or issues encountered
   - Current status

Important:
- Do NOT commit changes — leave them for review
- Follow any guidelines in CLAUDE.md if it exists
- Be thorough in your investigation before making changes
- Work autonomously — do not ask questions, make reasonable decisions
